# Introduction
- To help Elder people, specially for age group 65+ years old, live a healthier and better life, we can focus on a use case for elderly care
that addresses her specific needs and challenges. One common issue among older adults is the decline in memory, that it's hard to remember
everything.
- So here i am focusing on Usecase Reminder.
- Therefore, i created a working prototype of a Medication Reminder App that encourages regular taking of medication on time. so that se can
  enjoy healthier life.
- Please note that this is a simplified version. We can add extension in app like:
  -- Real time reminder.
  -- External Api() data that can provide info about medicine.
  -- Doctor consultation. and other feature like this.
